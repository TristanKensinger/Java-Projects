This was my first attempt at programming a tower defense game. I programmed this project my senior year in highschool. The game works as follows.
Players start with creating a path for the enemies to walk alone, this is done in the creation phase of the game. Note the path must go from the top left
of the screen to the bottom right. Once the path has been created the player can purchase their first defense and place it on the track. Money
will be generated every time a enemy is killed (different enemies give different values of money). There are also multiple types of defenses
with different abilities and stats. Each wave is hard coded so the types of enemies are predictable for the level that the player is currently on.

I created this project after already taking 2 years of programming classes. This experience helped me at the time to optimize and create more
efficient code.
