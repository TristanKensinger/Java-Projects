Honestly to this day, this is one of my favorite programs I have ever created. I created this project very early on in my programming
career so expect poorly written code, and yes, its a Applet. However, for what knowledge I possesed at the time, this was a huge accomplishment for
me.

I created this project for a STEM fair at my highschool. This game is inspired by one of my all time favorite games, The Binding of Isaac. This is also
the first game where I implemented sound and a highscore system the wrote to a external file and read back in the scores when the game was ran.

The game works as follows. You the player have 8 controls, WASD for movement, and the arrow keys to control which direction the player is firing in.
The player starts in a room with 4 doors. Entering any one of these doors will bring you to a room full of enemies and random obstacles in your path.
Once you defeat all of the enemies in your current room, the doors will once again unlock and you can continue through the dungeon.

This game really tested my OOP skills alongside my knowledge of state machines and collisions. I also spent alot of time optimizing the game as
it can get quite annoying trying to make pixel perfect dodges around enemies when the game is running at a low frame rate.

*I would love remaking this game in the future with the knowledge I have today*
