This was my final project in my AP Computer Science class back in highschool. At the time it was the largest program I have written. This game was inspired by
Minecraft and Terraria and consists of 16 total classes for its creation. I relied heavily on the concept of OOP as the game consists of a randomly generated world
full of blocks, ores, and caves. The game includes a currency system and a shop mechanic that allows the player to upgrade their abilities and stats.

Issues I had while creating this project mainly were focused with the aspect of procedural generation and how I was going to create a random world full of blocks.
I initially wanted to implement a version of Perlin Noise or some other noise algorithm for the ore and save spawn patterns, but with no built in packages for this
It made it difficult to finish in the time window provided. I ended up using a random walker algorithm for this task. If I ever remake this project I would probably use
a Noise algorithm for the ore generation and a Marching Squares algorithm for the cave generation.

*Also one of the first projects I did using JFrams instead of Applets*
