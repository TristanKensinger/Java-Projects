Hello! This was one of my first large scale games that I have ever made. With over 550 poorly written lines of code, I was able to create a simple platformer game.
This project was created as an Applet, this may make it hard to compile and run. However I will hopefully be getting around to creating a short youtube video just
showing of the program. Looking back, I have grown so much with my programming skill, this is a perfect example of humble beginnings. Enjoy :D

*Note, I created this project in BlueJ, hence the BlueJ files, I would reccomend running this program in a older version of BlueJ that supports Applets (Version 3.1.1)*
